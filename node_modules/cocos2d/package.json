There may be backwards incompatibilities which you'll need to debug.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions for your given platform or skip ahead to 'manual\r\ninstallation' if you want to install from git.\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n-------\r\n\r\nDownload and launch the installer.\r\n\r\n<http://cocos2d-javascript.org/downloads>\r\n\r\nMac OS X\r\n--------\r\n\r\nDownload the DMG and launch the installer.\r\n\r\n<http://cocos2d-javascript.org/downloads>\r\n\r\nLinux or Mac OS X using Node.js and NPM\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you have [Node.js][nodejs] and [npm][npm] installed you can install Cocos2D\r\nJavaScript as a global package.\r\n\r\nFor the latest stable release:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g cocos2d\r\n\r\nFor the latest unstable:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g cocos2d@unstable\r\n\r\nLinux or Mac OS X using Zip archive\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you don't have, or don't want to use npm, you can install by downloading the\r\nlatest Zip.\r\n\r\n<http://cocos2d-javascript.org/downloads>\r\n\r\nThen from your terminal run `sudo ./install.sh`. The script will copy Cocos2D\r\nJavaScript to a global location of your choice and symlink the executable to\r\n/usr/local/bin/cocos\r\n\r\nManual Installation (all platforms)\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou don't need to use the installer if you don't want to. You can download the\r\nlatest ZIP or checkout the latest version from github.\r\n\r\nIf you checkout from github and don't have Node.js installed, be sure to also\r\nget the git submodule which includes precompiled Node.js binaries.\r\n\r\n    git submodule update --init\r\n\r\nYou can put Cocos2D JavaScript anywhere you want and from there use the\r\n'cocos', 'cocos.bat' or .EXEs in _bin/_ to launch the various commands.\r\n\r\nCreating your first project\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nOn Windows use the 'Create project' shortcut from your start menu to create and\r\nselect a location for your new project.\r\n\r\nOn Linux and Mac OS X open your terminal and run:\r\n\r\n    cocos new ~/my_first_project\r\n\r\nThis will create a bare-bones project which simply draws the project name in the\r\ncentre of the screen.\r\n\r\nTo test that it's working, on Windows double click the 'Serve project' shortcut\r\nin your project's folder.\r\n\r\nOn Linux and Mac OS X from your terminal run:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/my_first_project\r\n    cocos server\r\n\r\nNow visit http://127.0.0.1:4000 and with a bit of luck you'll have something\r\nshowing.\r\n\r\nDeveloping\r\n==========\r\n\r\nCocos2D JavaScript uses a package called [Jah][jah] to handle development and\r\ncompilation. All the code you write will be in separate JavaScript files which\r\nyou can organise any way you wish. When it comes to deploying your application,\r\nJah will compile these files down into a small number of JavaScript files for\r\nyou to put on your webserver.\r\n\r\nThe entry point for the code is the file _src/main.js_ where you'll find an\r\n`exports.main` function which will be called when your application starts.\r\n\r\nThe HTML for the page sent by the development server is at\r\n_public/index.html.template_ and can be customised if you need any special\r\nalterations to it.\r\n\r\nCompiling your application\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nYou should never use the development server in production. It's slow and\r\ninsecure. Instead you will compile your application into a handful of\r\nJavaScript files. You'll get one file for each library that you use. So\r\nnormally you'll end up with three files: _jah.js_, _cocos2d.js_ and\r\n_application.js_. The first two are standard libraries that you can reuse in\r\nmultiple applications. While the third file is your application code.\r\n\r\nTo compile your project on Windows double click the 'Compile project' shortcut in your\r\nproject's folder.\r\n\r\nTo compile on Linux or Mac OS X open your terminal and run:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/my_first_project\r\n    cocos make\r\n\r\nThe files will be written to _build/_. You can run the resulting .js files\r\nthrough a JavaScript minifier if you so choose. You will also get a good\r\nreduction in size if your Web server is configured to gzip JavaScript files.\r\n\r\nBrowser Support\r\n===============\r\n\r\nEverything is designed to work in Firefox 4, Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE9+. If\r\nthat is not the case then please file a bug report.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be viewed online at <http://cocos2d-javascript.org/documentation>\r\n\r\nIf you wish to generate the documentation yourself you need to follow these steps.\r\n\r\nDownload JsDoc 2.3 (or 2.4) from <http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/>.\r\n\r\nCopy that to /usr/local/jsdoc-toolkit or wherever you like and then run:\r\n\r\n    JSDOC_HOME=/usr/local/jsdoc-toolkit ./bin/jsdoc\r\n\r\nThe documentation will appear in the 'docs' directory.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCocos2D JavaScript is released under the MIT license.
